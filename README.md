# python_for_research_HarvardX
In this repository I'm sharing my solutions to the homework that I had to solve during the course "Using Python for Research", by HarvadX (Harvard University), on edX platform. I am also sharing the course syllabus, and screenshots as evidence of the course completion, as I could not afford the official certificate.
