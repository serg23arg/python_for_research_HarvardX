# python_for_research_HarvardX
In this repository I'm sharing my solutions to the homework that I had to solve during the course "Using Python for Research", by HarvadX (Harvard University), on edX platform. I am also sharing the course syllabus, and screenshots as evidence of the course completion, as I could not afford the official certificate.

On each folder of exercises, you will find the original homework file (without solutions), in case you want to practice your skills and solved them by your own. Finally, you will find the solved version of each, with includes not only my solutions, but also the official ones, in those cases that were difference. This all small differences, but they produce the same result.
