In this case study, we will explore a cipher that is reported by contemporary Greek historians to have been used by Julius Caesar to send secret messages to generals during times of war.\n","\n","The Caesar cipher shifts each letter of a message to another letter in the alphabet located a fixed distance from the original letter. If our encryption key were `1`, we would shift `h` to the next letter `i`, `i` to the next letter `j`, and so on. If we reach the end of the alphabet, which for us is the space character, we simply loop back to `a`. To decode the message, we make a similar shift, except we move the same number of steps backwards in the alphabet.\n","\n","Over the next five exercises, we will create our own Caesar cipher, as well as a message decoder for this cipher. In this exercise, we will define the alphabet used in the cipher.\n","\n","#### Instructions\n","- The `string` library has been imported. Create a string called `alphabet` consisting of the space character `' '` followed by (concatenated with) the lowercase letters. Note that we're only using the lowercase letters in this exercise."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":10,"metadata":{"executionInfo":{"elapsed":346,"status":"ok","timestamp":1724516731749,"user":{"displayName":"Sergio Plaza","userId":"17934229959823265182"},"user_tz":180},"id":"O3ovdO35MKc1"},"outputs":[],"source":["import string\n","# write your code here!\n","\n","alphabet = ' ' + string.ascii_lowercase"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"CEyU9XPWMKc2"},"source":["### Exercise 2\n","\n","In this exercise, we will define a dictionary that specifies the index of each character in `alphabet`.\n","\n","#### Instructions\n","- `alphabet` has already defined in the last exercise.
